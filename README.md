## Recipe-App

This website is based on the [Recipe-Api](https://github.com/nataliausoltseva/Recipe-Api). 

### How to use it:
If a user wants to create a recipe card then they have to provide the following information:
  - Name of the Recipe
  - Difficulty
  - Image URL (optional)
  - Ingredients
  - Method

### How to run the project:
Clone the repo, navigate to the root directory, and type `npm install` in a new terminal window.

Once the node_modules folder has been created and all the dependencies have been successfully installed.

Run `npm run start` which will compile the project and allow you to view the app locally.

Note: The project has already been set up with a live reloader. This will compile and reload the web page on your `localhost port` automatically when you save any file in the project. Therefore, you will NOT have to run `npm run start` every time.
